/**
 * Test Exceptions in PHPUnit
 * Testing exceptions in PHP unit tests is crucial for verifying that your code handles error conditions correctly.
 * Here’s a detailed summary:

 * 1. Purpose:
 *    Exception testing ensures that your code throws the expected exceptions under specific conditions,
 *    such as invalid input or failed operations.
 *
 * 2. PHPUnit Approach:
 *    PHPUnit provides methods to test exceptions:
 *    - expectException(ExceptionType::class): Asserts that a specific exception type is thrown.
 *    - expectExceptionMessage('message'): Asserts that the exception message matches.
 *    - expectExceptionCode(code): Asserts that the exception code matches.
 *
 * 3. Typical Usage:
 *    Place the exception expectation before the code that should throw the exception.
 *
 *    public function testThrowsException()
 *    {
 *        // Assert that InvalidArgumentException is thrown
 *        $this->expectException(InvalidArgumentException::class);
 *        // Assert that the exception message matches
 *        $this->expectExceptionMessage('Invalid argument');
 *        $object = new MyClass();
 *        $object->methodThatThrows();
 *    }
 *
 * 4. Best Practices:
 *    - Test for both type and message to ensure precise error handling.
 *    - Use custom exception classes for better clarity.
 *    - Test edge cases and invalid inputs.
 *
 * 5. Benefits:
 *    - Improves code robustness.
 *    - Documents expected error behavior.
 *    - Prevents silent failures.
 *
 * Summary:
 * Testing exceptions with PHPUnit helps ensure your code fails gracefully and predictably,
 * making your applications more reliable and maintainable.
