/**
 * Software Testing - Detailed Summary
 *
 * Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software application or system
 * meets the specified requirements and works as expected. It helps identify bugs, errors, or missing requirements.
 *
 * Main Objectives:
 * 1. Verification: Ensures the product is built correctly according to specifications.
 * 2. Validation: Ensures the right product is built for the user's needs.
 * 3. Defect Detection: Identifies and fixes bugs before deployment.
 * 4. Quality Assurance: Improves the reliability, performance, and security of the software.
 *
 * Types of Software Testing:
 * - Manual Testing: Test cases are executed manually by testers without automation tools.
 * - Automated Testing: Uses scripts and tools to execute tests automatically.
 *
 * Levels of Testing:
 * 1. Unit Testing: Tests individual components or functions in isolation.
 * 2. Integration Testing: Tests interactions between integrated units or modules.
 * 3. System Testing: Tests the complete and integrated software system.
 * 4. Acceptance Testing: Validates the software against user requirements.
 *
 * Common Testing Techniques:
 * - Black Box Testing: Focuses on input and output without knowledge of internal code.
 * - White Box Testing: Involves testing internal structures or workings of an application.
 * - Grey Box Testing: Combines both black box and white box approaches.
 *
 * Benefits of Software Testing:
 * - Reduces development costs by detecting issues early.
 * - Enhances product quality and user satisfaction.
 * - Ensures software reliability and security.
 * - Facilitates easier maintenance and scalability.
 *
 * Conclusion:
 * Software testing is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) that ensures
 * the delivery of high-quality, reliable, and secure software products.
