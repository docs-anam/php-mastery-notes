/**
 * Detailed Summary: Test Suite in PHPUnit Testing
 *
 * A test suite in PHPUnit is a logical grouping of test cases or test classes, designed to be executed together.
 * Test suites help developers organize, manage, and run related tests efficiently, improving code quality and maintainability.
 *
 * Key Details:
 *
 * 1. Purpose:
 *    - Group related tests (e.g., all tests for a specific module, feature, or integration).
 *    - Enable batch execution of multiple tests, ensuring thorough coverage.
 *    - Facilitate targeted testing (run only relevant suites during development or CI).
 *
 * 2. Structure:
 *    - Test suites can be defined in two main ways:
 *      a) XML Configuration (phpunit.xml):
 *         - Suites are declared in the <testsuites> section.
 *         - Each <testsuite> can include files, directories, or classes.
 *         - Example:
 *           <phpunit>
 *             <testsuites>
 *               <testsuite name="User Module Tests">
 *                 <directory>./tests/User</directory>
 *                 <file>./tests/UserTest.php</file>
 *               </testsuite>
 *               <testsuite name="Order Module Tests">
 *                 <directory>./tests/Order</directory>
 *               </testsuite>
 *             </testsuites>
 *           </phpunit>
 *      b) Programmatic Definition (PHP Code):
 *         - Use PHPUnit\Framework\TestSuite to create suites in code.
 *         - Add test classes or other suites dynamically.
 *         - Example:
 *           use PHPUnit\Framework\TestSuite;
 *           $suite = new TestSuite('My Test Suite');
 *           $suite->addTestSuite(UserTest::class);
 *           $suite->addTestSuite(OrderTest::class);
 *           // Optionally, add another suite
 *           $anotherSuite = new TestSuite('Integration Tests');
 *           $suite->addTest($anotherSuite);
 *
 * 3. Usage:
 *    - Run all tests in a suite via the PHPUnit CLI:
 *      phpunit --testsuite "User Module Tests"
 *    - Suites can be nested for hierarchical organization (e.g., module suites within a project suite).
 *    - Suites can include individual test files, directories, or even other suites.
 *
 * 4. Benefits:
 *    - Simplifies test management by grouping related tests.
 *    - Enables selective execution (run only specific suites as needed).
 *    - Improves maintainability and scalability of test codebases.
 *    - Supports modular development and CI/CD workflows.
 *    - Facilitates parallel test execution for faster feedback.
 *
 * 5. Best Practices:
 *    - Organize suites by feature, module, or layer (unit, integration, functional).
 *    - Use descriptive names for suites to clarify their purpose.
 *    - Keep suites up-to-date as code evolves.
 *    - Leverage suite nesting for complex projects.
 *
 * 6. Example Directory Structure:
 *    /tests
 *      /User
 *        UserTest.php
 *        UserProfileTest.php
 *      /Order
 *        OrderTest.php
 *        PaymentTest.php
 *    phpunit.xml
 *
 * 7. Advanced Usage:
 *    - Combine suites for cross-module integration testing.
 *    - Use custom test runners or listeners with suites.
 *    - Filter tests within suites using annotations or CLI options.
 *
 * In summary, test suites in PHPUnit are a powerful mechanism for organizing, managing, and executing groups of tests. They are essential for maintaining robust, scalable, and maintainable codebases, especially in large or complex projects.
