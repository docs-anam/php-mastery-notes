/**
 * Mock Objects in PHP Unit Testing (Detailed Summary)
 *
 * Mock objects are simulated versions of real objects, created to mimic their behavior in a controlled environment.
 * They are essential in unit testing for isolating the code under test from its dependencies, ensuring that tests are focused, fast, and reliable.
 *
 * Key Points:
 *
 * 1. Purpose of Mock Objects:
 *    - Isolation: Replace real dependencies (e.g., database, external APIs, file systems) with mocks to avoid side effects and make tests deterministic.
 *    - Control: Define specific behaviors for dependencies, such as return values, thrown exceptions, or method call counts.
 *    - Verification: Assert that certain methods are called with expected arguments, or a specific number of times.
 *    - Safety: Prevent unwanted actions (e.g., sending emails, modifying data) during tests.
 *
 * 2. Usage in PHPUnit:
 *    - Creating Mocks: Use `$this->createMock(ClassName::class)` to generate a mock object for a given class.
 *    - Setting Expectations:
 *        - `$mock->expects($this->once())`: Expect the method to be called exactly once.
 *        - `->method('methodName')`: Specify which method to mock.
 *        - `->with($arg1, $arg2)`: Expect the method to be called with specific arguments.
 *        - `->willReturn($value)`: Define the return value for the mocked method.
 *        - `->willThrowException(new Exception())`: Simulate exceptions.
 *    - Example:
 *        Suppose you have a `Mailer` class and a `UserService` that uses it:
 *
 *        $mailerMock = $this->createMock(Mailer::class);
 *        $mailerMock->expects($this->once())
 *                   ->method('send')
 *                   ->with('user@example.com', 'Welcome!')
 *                   ->willReturn(true);
 *
 *        $userService = new UserService($mailerMock);
 *        $userService->register('user@example.com');
 *
 *    - Verifying Interactions: PHPUnit allows you to check if methods were called as expected, with correct arguments.
 *
 * 3. Types of Test Doubles:
 *    - Dummy: Passed as a parameter but never actually used.
 *    - Stub: Provides predefined responses to method calls, but does not verify interactions.
 *    - Mock: Records and verifies interactions (method calls, arguments).
 *    - Spy: Similar to mock, but records information for later verification.
 *    - Fake: Implements working functionality, but in a simplified way (e.g., in-memory database).
 *
 * 4. Benefits of Using Mocks:
 *    - Faster Tests: No need to interact with slow or unreliable external systems.
 *    - Deterministic Results: Tests always produce the same outcome, regardless of external factors.
 *    - Focused Testing: Isolate the unit under test, ensuring that failures are due to the code being tested, not its dependencies.
 *    - Improved Coverage: Test edge cases and error conditions that may be hard to reproduce with real dependencies.
 *
 * 5. Limitations and Considerations:
 *    - Overuse: Excessive mocking can lead to tests that are tightly coupled to implementation details, making refactoring harder.
 *    - Integration Gaps: Mocks do not test real interactions between components; integration tests are still necessary.
 *    - Maintenance: Changes in dependencies may require updates to mocks and expectations.
 *    - Realism: Mocks may not perfectly simulate complex behaviors of real objects.
 *
 * 6. Best Practices:
 *    - Mock only external dependencies, not the code under test.
 *    - Keep mocks simple and focused on the behavior being tested.
 *    - Use descriptive expectation messages to clarify test intent.
 *    - Combine unit tests with integration tests for comprehensive coverage.
 *
 * In summary, mock objects are powerful tools in PHP unit testing, enabling developers to isolate code, control dependencies, and verify interactions. Proper use of mocks leads to faster, more reliable, and maintainable tests, but should be balanced with integration testing to ensure overall system correctness.
