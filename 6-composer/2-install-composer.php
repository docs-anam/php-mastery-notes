/**
 * Detailed Guide: Installing Composer on Your Computer
 *
 * Composer is a powerful dependency manager for PHP, enabling you to easily manage libraries and packages in your projects.
 *
 * Installation Steps:
 *
 * 1. Check PHP Installation
 *    - Open your terminal or command prompt.
 *    - Run `php -v` to verify PHP is installed and check its version.
 *    - If PHP is not installed, download and install it from https://www.php.net/downloads.php.
 *    - Composer requires PHP version 7.2.5 or higher.
 *
 * 2. Download Composer Installer
 *    - Visit https://getcomposer.org/download/ for official instructions.
 *    - For Windows:
 *        - Download and run Composer-Setup.exe.
 *        - The installer will guide you through the setup and add Composer to your system PATH.
 *    - For Mac/Linux:
 *        - Run the following command in your terminal to download the installer:
 *          php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
 *
 * 3. (Optional) Verify Installer Integrity
 *    - For security, verify the installer’s signature:
 *        - Obtain the latest installer signature from https://composer.github.io/pubkeys.html.
 *        - Run:
 *          php -r "if (hash_file('SHA384', 'composer-setup.php') === 'YOUR_SIGNATURE') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
 *        - Replace 'YOUR_SIGNATURE' with the value from the Composer website.
 *
 * 4. Install Composer
 *    - For Mac/Linux:
 *        - Run:
 *          php composer-setup.php
 *        - This creates a composer.phar file in your current directory.
 *        - To use Composer globally, move composer.phar to a directory in your PATH:
 *          sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
 *    - For Windows:
 *        - The installer automatically sets up Composer and adds it to your PATH.
 *
 * 5. Verify Composer Installation
 *    - Run `composer --version` in your terminal or command prompt.
 *    - You should see the installed Composer version displayed.
 *
 * Additional Notes:
 *    - On Mac/Linux, you may need to use `sudo` for global installation steps.
 *    - Composer is essential for modern PHP development, allowing you to easily install, update, and manage project dependencies.
 *    - For troubleshooting or advanced usage, refer to the official documentation: https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md
