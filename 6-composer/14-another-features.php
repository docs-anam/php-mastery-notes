/**
 * Composer: Other Notable Features (Expanded)
 *
 * 1. Autoloading:
 *    - Composer generates an autoloader (vendor/autoload.php).
 *    - Supports PSR-4, PSR-0, classmap, and files autoloading.
 *
 * 2. Custom Scripts:
 *    - Define custom scripts in composer.json ("scripts" section).
 *    - Automate tasks (e.g., testing, code style checks, deployment).
 *    - Scripts can run before/after install/update or as custom commands.
 *    - Example:
 *      "scripts": {
 *        "test": "phpunit",
 *        "post-install-cmd": ["@test"]
 *      }
 *
 * 3. Plugins:
 *    - Extend Composer's functionality using plugins.
 *    - Plugins can handle custom installers, events, or integrate with other tools.
 *    - Install via composer require vendor/plugin.
 *    - Example: composer require composer/package-versions-deprecated
 *
 * 4. Vendor Binary (vendor/bin):
 *    - Composer installs CLI tools in vendor/bin.
 *    - Access binaries from dependencies (e.g., phpunit, phpcs).
 *    - Example: ./vendor/bin/phpunit
 *
 * 5. Custom/Private Repositories:
 *    - Use repositories other than Packagist (VCS, artifact, path, etc.).
 *    - Useful for private packages or local development.
 *    - Example:
 *      "repositories": [
 *        {
 *          "type": "vcs",
 *          "url": "git@github.com:your-org/private-repo.git"
 *        }
 *      ]
 *
 * 6. Package Version Constraints:
 *    - Flexible versioning: ^, ~, *, dev-branches, etc.
 *    - Ensures compatibility and stability.
 *
 * 7. Global Installation:
 *    - Install packages globally for CLI tools (e.g., composer global require ...).
 *
 * 8. Platform Requirements:
 *    - Specify PHP version and extensions required by your project.
 *    - Composer checks these before installing packages.
 *
 * 9. Outdated & Dependency Updates:
 *    - composer outdated: lists outdated packages.
 *    - composer update: updates dependencies according to constraints.
 *
 * 10. Composer Lock File:
 *    - composer.lock ensures consistent dependency versions across environments.
 *
 * 11. Package Discovery:
 *    - Some frameworks (e.g., Laravel) support automatic package discovery for service providers.
 *
 * 12. Environment Variables:
 *    - Use env variables in composer.json for configuration.
 *
 * 13. Composer Dump-Autoload:
 *    - Regenerate autoload files after adding/removing classes.
 *
 * 14. Composer Diagnose:
 *    - composer diagnose helps troubleshoot common issues.
 *
 * 15. Composer Proxies:
 *    - Configure proxies for network-restricted environments.
 *
 * 16. Composer Archive:
 *    - composer archive creates distributable package archives.
