/**
 * Summary: PHP Composer Repository
 *
 * A repository in Composer is a storage location where packages (libraries, projects) are published and made available for installation. Composer uses repositories to find and download dependencies for your PHP projects.
 *
 * Types of Composer Repositories:
 * 1. Packagist (Default): The main public repository for PHP packages. Most Composer packages are published here.
 *    - Website: https://packagist.org
 * 2. VCS (Version Control System): Directly reference packages from Git, Mercurial, or Subversion repositories.
 * 3. Path: Use local directories as repositories for development purposes.
 * 4. Artifact: Reference packages as ZIP or TAR files.
 * 5. Custom Repository: Host your own repository using Satis, Private Packagist, or Toran Proxy.
 *
 * Recommendations for Uploading or Getting Packages:
 * - For public/open-source packages, use Packagist.org. It is widely used and easy to integrate.
 * - For private or enterprise packages, consider Private Packagist (https://packagist.com), Satis (https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/handling-private-packages.md), or Toran Proxy.
 * - For documentation on repositories, refer to: https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md
 *
 * How to Add a Repository in composer.json:
 * {
 *   "repositories": [
 *     {
 *       "type": "vcs",
 *       "url": "https://github.com/vendor/package"
 *     }
 *   ]
 * }
