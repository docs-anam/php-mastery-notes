/**
 * Documentation: Removing an Existing Composer Library
 *
 * This guide explains the steps to safely remove a Composer package from your PHP project.
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1. Identify the package to remove by checking your `composer.json` file.
 * 2. Use the Composer CLI to remove the package:
 *      composer remove vendor/package-name
 *    Example: composer remove monolog/monolog
 * 3. Composer will update `composer.json` and `composer.lock`, and delete the package from `vendor/`.
 * 4. Remove any manual references to the package in your codebase.
 * 5. Optionally, run `composer install` to ensure dependencies are up-to-date.
 * 6. Commit the updated `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files if using version control.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Removing a package may impact other dependencies.
 * - Always test your application after making changes to dependencies.
