<!-- 
 To install PHP, you can use local development environments such as XAMPP, MAMP, or WAMP.
 These tools bundle PHP with other necessary components like Apache and MySQL, making setup easier.
 Alternatively, you can install PHP directly from the official website or use package managers like Homebrew (macOS), apt (Ubuntu), or choco (Windows).
 After installation, verify PHP by running `php -v` in your terminal or command prompt. -->

<!-- To write and edit PHP code, you can use text editors such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, or Notepad++.
 These editors offer features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and extensions that enhance PHP development.
 Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like PhpStorm or Eclipse PDT provide even more advanced tools for PHP projects. -->
