# Operators Assignment

```php
// Assignment Operators in PHP

// Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
// The most basic assignment operator is "=".

// 1. Basic Assignment
$a = 10; // assigns the value 10 to $a

// 2. Addition Assignment
$a += 5; // equivalent to $a = $a + 5; $a is now 15

// 3. Subtraction Assignment
$a -= 3; // equivalent to $a = $a - 3; $a is now 12

// 4. Multiplication Assignment
$a *= 2; // equivalent to $a = $a * 2; $a is now 24

// 5. Division Assignment
$a /= 4; // equivalent to $a = $a / 4; $a is now 6

// 6. Modulus Assignment
$a %= 5; // equivalent to $a = $a % 5; $a is now 1

// 7. Concatenation Assignment (for strings)
$str = "Hello";
$str .= " World!"; // equivalent to $str = $str . " World!"; $str is now "Hello World!"

// Summary:
// Assignment operators combine assignment with another operation.
// They provide a shorthand way to update the value of a variable.
