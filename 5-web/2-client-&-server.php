/**
 * Summary: Client and Server in Web Development
 *
 * Client:
 * - The client is typically a web browser or any application that interacts with a web server.
 * - It sends requests to the server, usually via HTTP or HTTPS protocols.
 * - The client displays data received from the server, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.
 * - Examples: Google Chrome, Firefox, mobile apps, REST API consumers.
 *
 * Server:
 * - The server is a computer or software that listens for requests from clients.
 * - It processes incoming requests, performs necessary operations (like database queries), and sends responses back.
 * - Web servers (like Apache, Nginx) serve static files or run server-side scripts (PHP, Python, Node.js).
 * - The server can enforce security, manage sessions, and handle business logic.
 *
 * Client-Server Interaction:
 * 1. The client initiates a request (e.g., user enters a URL or submits a form).
 * 2. The server receives the request, processes it, and prepares a response.
 * 3. The server sends the response (HTML, JSON, etc.) back to the client.
 * 4. The client renders or processes the response for the user.
 *
 * Key Differences:
 * - The client is user-facing; the server is backend-facing.
 * - The client requests resources; the server provides resources.
 * - The client runs on the user's device; the server runs on a remote machine.
