/**
 * PHP Web Development Summary
 *
 * PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a popular server-side scripting language designed for web development.
 * It is widely used to create dynamic web pages and web applications.
 *
 * Key Concepts:
 * 1. Server-Side Execution:
 *    - PHP code is executed on the server, and the result (usually HTML) is sent to the client's browser.
 *    - Clients do not see the PHP code, only the output.
 *
 * 2. Embedding in HTML:
 *    - PHP can be embedded directly within HTML using <?php ... ?> tags.
 *    - This allows dynamic content generation within static HTML pages.
 *
 * 3. Request Handling:
 *    - PHP scripts can handle HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.).
 *    - Data from forms or URLs can be accessed using $_GET, $_POST, $_REQUEST, and $_SERVER superglobals.
 *
 * 4. Database Interaction:
 *    - PHP supports various databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.).
 *    - Commonly uses PDO or MySQLi extensions for database operations.
 *
 * 5. Session and Cookie Management:
 *    - PHP can manage user sessions using $_SESSION and $_COOKIE.
 *    - Useful for authentication, shopping carts, and user preferences.
 *
 * 6. File Handling:
 *    - PHP can read, write, upload, and manipulate files on the server.
 *
 * 7. Security:
 *    - Important to validate and sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other attacks.
 *    - Use prepared statements for database queries.
 *
 * 8. Frameworks and Tools:
 *    - Popular PHP frameworks: Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter, Zend.
 *    - Composer is the dependency manager for PHP.
 *
 * 9. Output:
 *    - PHP can generate HTML, JSON, XML, or any other text-based format.
 *    - Useful for building APIs as well as web pages.
 *
 * Example:
 * <form method="post">
 *   <input type="text" name="name">
 *   <input type="submit">
 * </form>
 * <?php
 * if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
 *     echo "Hello, " . htmlspecialchars($_POST['name']);
 * }
 * ?>
 *
 * Summary:
 * PHP is a versatile language for building web applications, offering features for dynamic content, database integration, session management, and security. Its ease of embedding in HTML and wide hosting support make it a foundational technology for web development.
