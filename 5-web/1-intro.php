/**
 * Introduction to the Web
 *
 * The World Wide Web (often called "the web") is a vast system that lets people find, share, and interact with information using the internet.
 * It works through websites, which are collections of web pages you can visit using a web browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
 *
 * How does it work?
 * - When you type a website address (URL) into your browser, your computer sends a request over the internet to a web server.
 * - The web server is a special computer that stores website files.
 * - The server finds the page you asked for and sends it back to your browser.
 * - Your browser then displays the page, which can include text, images, videos, and interactive features.
 *
 * Websites can be:
 * - Static: showing the same content to everyone.
 * - Dynamic: changing content based on user actions or data (like showing your name after you log in).
 *
 * The web uses technologies like HTML (for structure), CSS (for design), and JavaScript (for interactivity).
 * PHP is a programming language that runs on the server and helps create dynamic websites. It can process forms, manage user accounts, and connect to databases.
 *
 * In summary, the web connects people and information worldwide, making it easy to communicate, learn, shop, and share.
