 * Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation in PHP 8.0 - Detailed Summary & Setup Guide
 *
 * 1. Introduction:
 *    - JIT stands for "Just-In-Time" compilation.
 *    - Introduced in PHP 8.0 as a major performance feature.
 *    - JIT compiles parts of the PHP bytecode into native machine code at runtime, potentially improving performance.
 *
 * 2. How PHP Executes Code (Pre-PHP 8.0):
 *    - PHP code is parsed and compiled into opcodes (intermediate bytecode).
 *    - Opcodes are interpreted by the Zend VM (virtual machine).
 *    - No native machine code is generated; all execution is interpreted.
 *
 * 3. What JIT Changes:
 *    - JIT translates frequently used opcodes into machine code on-the-fly.
 *    - This reduces interpretation overhead and can speed up execution.
 *    - JIT is integrated into the Opcache extension.
 *
 * 4. JIT Compilation Modes:
 *    - Tracing JIT: Compiles hot code paths based on runtime profiling.
 *    - Function JIT: Compiles entire functions.
 *    - Configurable via php.ini (opcache.jit, opcache.jit_buffer_size).
 *
 * 5. Performance Impact:
 *    - For typical web applications, JIT offers modest improvements.
 *    - For CPU-intensive tasks (math, loops, scientific computing), JIT can provide significant speedups.
 *    - Not all PHP code benefits equally; I/O-bound code sees little change.
 *
 * 6. Steps to Enable JIT on a Server:
 *    a. Prerequisites:
 *       - PHP 8.0 or newer installed.
 *       - Opcache extension enabled (default in most PHP 8 installations).
 *
 *    b. Update php.ini:
 *       - Locate your php.ini file (use `php --ini` or check your server config).
 *       - Add or update the following lines:
 *         opcache.enable=1
 *         opcache.enable_cli=1
 *         opcache.jit_buffer_size=100M
 *         opcache.jit=tracing
 *
 *    c. Restart Web Server:
 *       - For Apache:
 *         sudo systemctl restart apache2
 *         # or
 *         sudo service apache2 restart
 *       - For Nginx (with PHP-FPM):
 *         sudo systemctl restart php8.0-fpm
 *         sudo systemctl restart nginx
 *
 *    d. Verify JIT Status:
 *       - Create a PHP file with:
 *         <?php phpinfo(); ?>
 *       - Access it in your browser and search for "JIT" under the Opcache section.
 *
 * 7. Nginx & Apache Specific Notes:
 *    - Apache (mod_php): JIT is enabled via the main php.ini.
 *    - Nginx (PHP-FPM): Edit the php.ini used by PHP-FPM (often /etc/php/8.0/fpm/php.ini).
 *    - After changes, always restart the relevant PHP service and web server.
 *
 * 8. Limitations:
 *    - JIT does not optimize all PHP code.
 *    - Debugging and profiling may be more complex.
 *    - Some extensions or code patterns may not benefit.
 *
 * 9. Conclusion:
 *    - JIT in PHP 8.0 is a foundational step for future performance improvements.
 *    - Best suited for computation-heavy workloads.
 *    - For most web apps, expect incremental gains rather than dramatic speedups.
